 Option to ask her:
quickQuestion
"Are you okay?" to which she replies (angry) "Do I look like I'm freaking okay?"
"Can I help you?" response (tearful smile) "Don't give me that customer servce BS."
"Well, Morris is a pillock." response (tearful smile) "too freaking right."
"What have you done?" response (angry) "Oh, so it's MY fault now? Gods, @, I thought we were friends."

"I hate him, sometimes I wish I could just freaking quit."

question: Choice: "Why don't you?" or "stay quiet". Neither actually changes the way the scene proceeds.

Juliet then reveals part of why she's in Pelican Town.
"Because I can't, all right? You do the crime, you do the time. And it's not like I don't deserve it. Have you ever done something so freaking terrible that just made you wish you could restart the day afresh and do things different?"
Pause, emote farmer something: ... or sweatdrop maybe?
"No? Well I have, and I did. And no, I don't want to talk about it." (make her pace back and forth so it's not all dialogue boxes). "And if I'm exiled to this tiny town in the tail-end of nowhere and indentured to the megacorp master, so what? I got off lightly. He didn't."
Farmer moves towards her (emote suggesting comforting?). Juliet jerks away and paces back and forth.

quickQuestion??
"What did you do?": Juliet angry emote. "I was young and dumb. Not that that's any freaking excuse. And what part of 'I don't want to talk about it don't you understand? But, I 'spose it's gonna come out sooner or later, so I might as well tell you."
"I'm here for you.": Juliet ... emote. Pause. "Really? Are you sure about that, @? You might not be, if you knew the full story." Emote farmer shaky smile. "I suppose I'd better tell you, so you can run for the hills now while you still have the chance."
"Did you kill someone?" Juliet turns her back, steps away. Shakes. Juliet emote ... textAboveHead Juliet \"No.\"/pause 1000/textAboveHead Juliet \"Not exactly...\"/pause 500/
