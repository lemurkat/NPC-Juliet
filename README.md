# NPC-Juliet
Adds NPCs Juliet and Gale, plus their house.

Juliet is a troubled young woman exiled to Pelican Town for reasons unknown. She and her landlord/housemate/friend work rotating shifts at the JojaMart. Juliet is sharp-tongued, flirty, and irrepressible. Gale is matronly, empathic, and a keen gardener.

A third housemate can be added, by installing NPC Jade, designed by Malic.

**This mod is a work in progress. It is NOT compatible with SVE.**

Lodging House: 
- Fully functional
- compatible with: Karmylla's Immersive Maps, Stardew Reimagined 2.
- requires Daisy Niko Tilesheets to load.

Juliet: 
- Heart events 2, 4 and 6 implemented.
- Schedule organized for Joja, Community Center and Theater
- Needs additional Dialogue and current dialogue/heart events subject to change.
- Marriage Dialogue incomplete.
- Marriage schedule not done.
- Adds Gremlin after seeing 4-heart event if antisocial NPCs installed.
- festival dialogue/costumes/positions only coded for spring.

- please note that the 6-heart event takes place in the JojaMart. As the core game does not contain a Data/Events/JojaMart.xnb, this mod will install one. If you are running NPC Nikolai, NPC Herbert, SVE (despite the lack of compatibility mentioned above), or another mod that LOADs the Events/JojaMart you will need to disable the config - in which case it will just edit the already existing file. Given that there is a chance you may install Juliet post-CC completion, there will also be an alternative variant of the 4-heart and 6-heart scenes with a different setting, although this has yet to be written.

If you are running Reimagined2, you should do a world terrain reset on the town map before you trigger the 4-heart event. This is to remove some of the bushes that mod adds that inhibited the movement of the characters and rendered the scene awkwardly. After seeing the event, you can reset it again to have them reappear if you wish.

Gale:
- limited dialogue.
- no heart events.
- schedule implemented for Joja with JojaMartReplacement alternative.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Content Patcher
- TMXL
- DaisyNiko Tilesheets

Recommended:
- Antisocial NPCs (without this mod, Gremlin won't load as a character and will only appear in heart events)
- NPC Jade (Malic and I are currently collaborating to bring Jade into the lodging house)
